Our Hospital Management System is designed to streamline and enhance the administrative and clinical operations within a healthcare facility. 

This project focuses on creating two main models: Admin and Doctor.

Admin Model:
The Admin model is responsible for managing appointments within the system. Admins have the following capabilities:

Add Appointment: Admins can schedule new appointments by entering patient details, appointment date, time, and the assigned doctor.
View Appointment Details: Admins can view a list of all scheduled appointments, including patient information and appointment times.
Manage Doctors: Admins can also add and manage doctor profiles, ensuring that all relevant information is up-to-date.

Doctor Model:
The Doctor model is designed to allow doctors to manage their appointments and patient interactions. Doctors have the following capabilities:

View Appointments: Doctors can see a list of their upcoming appointments, including patient details and the scheduled times.
Update Appointments: Doctors can update appointment details if changes are needed, such as rescheduling or modifying patient information.
Delete Appointments: Doctors have the authority to cancel appointments if necessary.

Medicine Stock:
The system also allows doctors to manage the stock of medicines. The Medicine entity is used to keep track of medical supplies. Doctors can:

View Medicine Stock: Check the current stock of medicines available.
Add Medicine: Add new medicines to the inventory.

Summary
This Hospital Management System aims to improve efficiency and communication within the hospital by providing clear 
roles and functionalities for both admins and doctors. Admins focus on organizing and scheduling appointments, 
while doctors handle the clinical side of patient appointments. Together, these roles ensure a smooth and effective 
management process, benefiting both the hospital staff and the patients.
